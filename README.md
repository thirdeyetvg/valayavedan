# Valaya Vedan is a free PDF to Unicode converter mainly for Visually challenged persons. 
Note: This is still in pre-release state. We'll keep updating.
# Description:
Visually challenged persons can read any Unicode texts using screen reader. The PDF documents contain non standard fonts other than Unicode and Images. The Text To Speech softwares cannot read those contents. Valaya Vedan helps to read the PDF content by extracting, processing and converting them to Unicode easily.
Valaya vedan supports reading content from Text PDF and Image PDF.
# Reading Image PDF files
Image PDFs will have the pages as scanned images. Valaya Vedan allows in loading the Image PDF and converting the image to text. In the background, Tesseract OCR is used to convert the images. For now PDF Image extraction is being done in Java. So Java is a dependency for reading image PDFs. One time setup of Java path is needed. If the Java path is not set, user will be prompted to setup the Java path (we'll make the detection automated soon). Use this URL https://java.com/en/download/ to download JRE.
Java path will be of this format, 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_version\bin
Once Image PDF file is opened, pagination control will come up. Upon navigation to a particular page, the text processing will be done automatically. Use arrow keys to read the content within the page.
We'll be adding mode languages soon.
